## 🎯 The Problem: AI's Cognitive Limitations

Current AI systems face fundamental limitations:

1. **Context Amnesia**: Stateless models forget between interactions, requiring constant re-prompting
2. **No Learning**: Cannot improve from experience without expensive retraining
3. **Single-Model Bottlenecks**: Reliance on one LLM creates failure points and scaling issues
4. **Limited Autonomy**: Require human intervention for complex multi-step tasks
5. **Poor Tool Integration**: Struggle with reliable tool execution and error recovery

These limitations cost businesses billions in lost productivity and prevent AI from achieving true autonomy.
